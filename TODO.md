# TODO

In theory this will become a roughly stack ranked list of stuff that needs doing.

* improve the root readme
* setup alb with acm to route https traffic to nodes
* figure out what I need to do to redirect http traffic back to https
* ci/cd instance
    * larger standalone instance (not part of k3s) 
    * need to be able to start/stop easy and only run when using it
    * docker repo + jenkins
* build a simple haskell wai app with jenkins pipeline
* sort out cli deploy
    * for now don't support deploy from jenkins
