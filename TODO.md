# TODO

In theory this will become a roughly stack ranked list of stuff that needs doing.

* improve the root readme
* setup alb with acm to route https traffic to nodes
* figure out what I need to do to redirect http traffic back to https
* build a simple haskell wai app
* publish to hub.docker.com for now
* get deployment process sorted
* figure out ci/cd pipeline
